# Project Title: Active Layer Thickness and it's attributes in Permafrost regions
## Researcher: Azadeh Dadfarin
## Summary and Problem Statement:
**The active layer is the top layer of soil that freezes and thaws seasonally in permafrost regions. This influences ecosystems and infrastructure in permafrost regions. So in this project, changes in ALT over time using time-series data from remote sensing or ground-based observations would be investigated. Also, I would like to estimate the rates of permafrost thawing. The limitations I have faced till now is related to Metadata or Big data availablity. In some cases there are various parameters measured but with limited number of points or samples and in larger datsets, there is just one parameter of ALT( Active Layer THickness) which has been monitored. Utilizing satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, NDVI) to monitor land surface changes and vegetation dynamics would be helpful as well. Finally, I am intended to apply machine learning algorithms to classify and predict active layer properties based on geospatial data. I will need to conduct spatial and temporal analysis using tools like QGIS.With this respect, both ground-based and remote sensing data are needed.** 
### Objectives:
1- Creating visualizations using Matplotlib  
2- Interpreting the results to understand the processes governing active layer dynamics, using ground-truth data  
3- Generating models to predict ALT using SciPy and Scikit-learn
